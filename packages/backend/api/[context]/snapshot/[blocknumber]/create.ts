// create a snapshot for a given blocknumber
// get the delegation set for the blocknumber via specifying blocknumber in the query to the subgraphs
// must figure out how to find the correct blocknumber for the subgraphs that are not the main chain
// must use the timestamp of the block on the main chain to figure out correct blocknumber for other chains
